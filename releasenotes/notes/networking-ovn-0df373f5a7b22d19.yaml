    This is the initial release of OpenStack neutron integration with OVN.
    OVN provides virtual networking for Open vSwitch and is a component of
    the `Open vSwitch <http://openvswitch.org/>`_ project. The following
    virtual networking features are available. Some features are provided
    via a native OVN implementation or via a conventional neutron agent.

    * Layer-2 switching (native OVN implementation)
    * Layer-3 routing (native OVN implementation or conventional
      neutron layer-3 agent) The native OVN implementation supports
      distributed routing. However, it currently lacks support for
      floating IP addresses and NAT.
    * DHCP (native OVN implementation or conventional neuron DHCP agent)
      The native implementation supports distributed DHCP. However,
      it currently lacks IPv6 support and support for the Neutron
      internal DNS and metadata proxy features.
    * Metadata (conventional neutron metadata agent)
    * DPDK - May be used with OVS using either the Linux kernel
      datapath or the DPDK datapath.

    The initial release also supports the following neutron API
    extensions, ``agent``, ``Address Scopes`` \*,
    ``Allowed Address Pairs``, ``Auto Allocated Topology Services``,
    ``Availability Zone``, ``Default Subnetpools``,
    ``DHCP Agent Scheduler`` \*\*, ``Distributed Virtual Router`` \*,
    ``DNS Integration`` \*, ``HA Router extension`` \*,
    ``L3 Agent Scheduler`` \*,
    ``Network Availability Zone`` \*\*, ``Network IP Availability``,
    ``Neutron external network``, ``Neutron Extra DHCP opts``,
    ``Neutron Extra Route``,
    ``Neutron L3 Configurable external gateway mode`` \*,
    ``Neutron L3 Router``,
    ``Network MTU``, ``Port Binding``, ``Port Security``,
    ``Provider Network``, ``Quality of Service``,
    ``Quota management support``, ``RBAC Policies``,
    ``Resource revision numbers``,
    ``Router Availability Zone`` \*, ``security-group``,
    ``standard-attr-description``, ``Subnet Allocation``,
    ``Tag support`` and ``Time Stamp Fields``.

    (\*) Only applicable when conventional neutron layer-3 agent enabled.

    (\*\*) Only applicable when conventional DHCP agent enabled.
