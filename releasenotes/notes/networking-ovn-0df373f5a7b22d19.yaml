    Initial release of the OpenStack Networking service (neutron)
    integration with Open Virtual Network (OVN), a component of the
    the `Open vSwitch <http://openvswitch.org/>`_ project. OVN provides
    the following features either via native implementation or
    conventional agents:

    * Layer-2 (native OVN implementation)
    * Layer-3 (native OVN implementation or conventional layer-3 agent)
      The native OVN implementation supports distributed routing. However,
      it currently lacks support for floating IP addresses, NAT, and the
      metadata proxy.
    * DHCP (native OVN implementation or conventional DHCP agent)
      The native implementation supports distributed DHCP. However,
      it currently lacks support for IPv6, internal DNS, and metadata
      proxy.
    * Metadata (conventional metadata agent)
    * DPDK - Usable with OVS via either the Linux kernel datapath
      or the DPDK datapath.
    * Trunk driver - Driver to back the neutron's 'trunk' service plugin

    The initial release also supports the following Networking service
    API extensions:

    * ``agent``

    * ``Neutron L3 Configurable external gateway mode`` \*
    * ``Neutron L3 Router``
    * ``Network MTU``
    * ``Port Binding``
